# BDD Mobile Security Testing
Because many companies are embracing the Agile transformation, the integration of the security in the Continuous Delivery / Integration is becoming more and more important and effective. 

As part of continuous delivery and the Agile software development, the mobile applications play an important role.

BDDsecurity offers a complete set of BDD security tests with Calabash,Cucumber and Ruby, following the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide and the OWASP Mobile Top 10 2016, that can be easily implemented through the entire pipeline.

The tests use the power of [calabash.io](https://calabash.io) to automate the UI, [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and Gherkin for its simple language.

In order to use the tests you need to install the calabash sandbox, following this [guide](https://github.com/calabash/install).

## OWASP MASVS and MSTG
The repo's structure is based on the [OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs) and the corresponding tests from the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg). For each test many features are defined with corresponding steps.
